# In The Bag

Work in progress/coming soon!

Find out what equipment the top golfers use. Create new players and update existing ones.

This is a personal project to sharpen some skills and to try out some new tech.

Plan is to use Netlify for hosting and to create Netlify Functions to handle responses for the API back end.

For the front end i'll be starting with Vite to create a react with typescript build. I want to use React Query/TanStack Query for the asynchronous state management, as an alternative to using my usual Redux approach.

Tailwind for the CSS.


Sneaky peek...
